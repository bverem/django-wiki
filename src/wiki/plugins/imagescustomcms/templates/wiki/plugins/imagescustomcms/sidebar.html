<!-- images plugin process:

Upload image (1-1 with article)
That gets inserted into the sidebar
You click on Insert Image and select some additional attributes
Submitting the form will add the appropriate markdown to the text

<!-- My process
Okay, so it's really hard to flexibly use a custom asset form with the requisite views/javascript/etc. So I'll just redirect to a page I control and copy stuff in. Should be much easier (and perhaps can refactor this to be a plugin like PubMed?)

//Make a custom form in my app (search for an asset with fields for customization) and pass that as a wiki plugin option
//Load said form in wiki_plugin (which will pass it here?) with appropriate kwargs
//Onclick for Select Asset -> Open modal with form
//Pick an asset and have additional attributes (ideally have a preview button)
//Give the option to insertAtCaret or copy/pasta
//Insert markdown into text or allow copy/pasta

-->
